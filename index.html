            <p>Hello! Jodi Tivis here. Thank you for taking a peek at my site. One day it will be filled with my own creations, but for now a few nice placeholder photos will do.</p>
            <p>I live in Fort Collins, Colorado with my fiance. I currently work in Denver as a personal assistant and do photography on the side.</p>
            <p>I have been eager to find my niche in the career world; and somehow University of Denver's Web Development Coding Bootcamp fell in my lap and I knew this was something I needed to jump into.</p>
            <p>I am brand new to coding, I love to learn, and I am eager for where this journey will lead me as I continue.</p>
